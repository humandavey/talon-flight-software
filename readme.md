# Talon Flight Software [humandavey, Spaceret]

### About

The Talon rocket is a rocket that me and a friend worked on over the 2023 summer break. This is a single-stage rocket that is almost completely fully 3d printed.

### Software

We use this software running on a raspberry pi zero 2w that has a BMP390 for altitude, pressure, and temperature readings to detect launch, and apogee to fire the parachute on time, every time. We then ssh into the raspberry pi from another laptop connected to a hotspot to launch the rocket and keep track of data (unless it disconnects in which it can fly by itself).

### Hardware

The rocket is still being developed and tested, but this page will update with a full blog once rocket development is over.

`Do not use this software on another rocket, just write your own please`
